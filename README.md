### Packaging Details

Packaging is done using pyinstaller to create a binary for the program. This must be done on the native OS (it is not possible to "cross compile"). As such, github actions is used for the builds.

Widows additionally uses InnoSetup to create an installer for the program.

Linux additionally uses appimagetool to create an AppImage file for the program. Linux builds should be done on an older distribution (older glibc) to ensure broad compatibility.
